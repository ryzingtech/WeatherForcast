This awareness is crucial as it highlights the impact of climate change, including rising global temperatures, sea levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events. By promoting climate change awareness, we can encourage sustainable practices, influence policy changes, and foster collective action to mitigate its effects. Everyone has a role to play in combating climate change by reducing their carbon footprint, conserving energy, and supporting renewable energy sources. Together, we can work towards a more sustainable and resilient future for our planet."</p>

        <p>The Paris Agreement is an international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to below 2°C, with efforts to keep it to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It represents a landmark moment in global climate policy and emphasizes the need for collective action to combat climate change.</p>

        <h3>Case Study 3: Impact of Climate Change on the Great Barrier Reef</h3>
        <img src="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/coralreef-climate.jpg" alt="Great Barrier Reef">
        <p>The Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's most iconic coral reefs, is severely affected by climate change. Rising ocean temperatures and acidification are causing widespread coral bleaching and threatening marine biodiversity. Conservation efforts are crucial to protect this natural wonder.</p>
